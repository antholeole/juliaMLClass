This project is a small-recreation of [Forrest Bao's awesome MLClass repo](https://github.com/forrestbao/MLClass).

All the exercises in this repository are the completed versions of the exercises in that repo, just completed in Julia.

The following Julia packages are used. Please install them so that everything works properly:

- Distributions (for generating mock data)
- LaTeXStrings (To allow LaTeX output in plots)
- MLJ (Machine Learning Julia!)
- MLUtils (Some helpful tools for machine learning)
- Plots (Plotting)
- RDatasets (used to download datasets easily. We utilize this in the SVM exercise)

I make absolutely no claims that this is idiomatic Julia. I've never done Data Science work before this semester, so the quality of this work will probably make me cringe in 2-3 years. PR's are welcome, if only to teach me how to Julia better :).
